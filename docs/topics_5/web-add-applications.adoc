= Adding applications to a project

You can add applications to a migration project by using one of the following methods:

* Uploading applications
* Registering the directory path of each application

Uploading applications stores them directly in the {ProductShortName} server.

Registering the directory path of an application tells the {ProductShortName} server its location. This method is useful if you expect to update the application because it ensures that the {ProductShortName} server always uses the latest version of the application..
