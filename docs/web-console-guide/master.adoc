* Developer view

In *Administrator* view, you configure the instance environment, working with credentials, repositories, and HTTP and HTTPS proxy definitions.

In *Developer* view, you perform application assessments and analyses, review reports, and add applications for assessment and analysis.

// We need an intro about the two views.

[id="assessing-and-analyzing-applications"]
== Assessing and analyzing applications

You can use the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} to both assess and to analyze applications.

Assessing applications refers to estimating the risks and costs involved in preparing applications for containerization, including time, personnel, and other factors. The results of an assessment can be used as the basis for discussions between stakeholders to determine which applications are good candidates for containerization, which require significant work, and which are not suitable for containerization.

Analyzing applications refers to using rules to determine which specific lines in an application must be modified before the application can be migrated or modernized.
