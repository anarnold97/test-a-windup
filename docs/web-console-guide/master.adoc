[id=mta-6-ui-interface-views]
== User interface views

The {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} has two views:

* Administration view
* Migration view

In *Administration* view, you configure the instance environment, working with credentials, repositories, HTTP and HTTPS proxy definitions, custom migration targets, and issue management.

In *Migration* view, you perform application assessments and analyses, review reports, and add applications for assessment and analysis.

// == Administration view

// Installation
include::topics/mta-6-installing-web-console-on-openshift.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

* Custom migration targets
* Issue management

[id="general-configuration"]
=== General

You can enable or disable the following options:

* Reviewing applications without running an assessment first
* Downloading HTML reports
* Downloading CSV reports

[id="configuring-credentials"]
=== Configuring credentials

You can configure the following types of credentials in *Administration* view:

* Source control
* Maven
* Proxy

[id="creating-configuring-jira-connection"]
== Creating and configuring a Jira connection

You can track application migrations by creating a Jira issue for each migration from within the {ProductShortName} {WebName}. To be able to create Jira issues, you first need to do the following:

. Create an {ProductShortName} credential to authenticate to the API of the Jira instance that you create in the next step.
. Create a Jira instance in {ProductShortName} and establish a connection to that instance.

include::topics/mta-web-config-jira-credentials.adoc[leveloffset=2]
include::topics/mta-web-create-config-jira-connection.adoc[leveloffset=2]

[NOTE]
====
A Jira connection that was used for xref:../../../docs/topics/mta-web-creating-jira-issues-for-migration-wave.adoc#mta-web-creating-jira-issues-for-migration-wave_{context}[creating issues for a migration wave] cannot be removed as long as the issues exist in Jira, even after the migration wave is deleted.

[id="assessing-and-analyzing-applications"]
== Assessing and analyzing applications
You can use the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} to both assess and to analyze applications.

Assessing applications refers to estimating the risks and costs involved in preparing applications for containerization, including time, personnel, and other factors. The results of an assessment can be used as the basis for discussions between stakeholders to determine which applications are good candidates for containerization, which require significant work, and which are not suitable for containerization.

Analyzing applications refers to using rules to determine which specific lines in an application must be modified before the application can be migrated or modernized.
