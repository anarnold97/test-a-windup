= Installing the {ProductName} {WebName}

You install the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {WebName} as part of the process of installing the {ProductShortName} Operator on the OpenShift Container Platform.

The {ProductShortName} Operator is a structural layer that manages resources deployed on Kubernetes (database, front end, back end) to automatically create a {ProductShortName} instance instead of you doing it manually.

== Persistent volume requirements

The {ProductShortName} Operator requires a total of 5 persistent volumes (PVs) used by different components to successfully deploy, 3 RWO volumes and 2 RWX volumes that are requested via PVCs. These PVS are described in the table below:
