=== Issues report

Access this report from the dashboard by clicking the *Issues* link.

This report includes details about every issue that was raised by the selected migration paths. The following information is provided for each issue encountered:

* A title to summarize the issue.
* The total number of incidents, or times the issue was encountered.
* The rule story points to resolve a single instance of the issue.
* The estimated level of effort to resolve the issue.
* The total story points to resolve every instance encountered. This is calculated by multiplying the number of incidents found by the story points per incident.

.Issues report
image::3-4-issues-report.png[Issues report]

Each reported issue can be expanded, by clicking on the title, to obtain additional details. The following information is provided.

* A list of files where the incidents occurred, along with the number of incidents within each file. If the file is a Java source file, then clicking the filename will direct you to the corresponding Source report.
* A detailed description of the issue. This description outlines the problem, provides any known solutions, and references supporting documentation regarding either the issue or resolution.
* A direct link, entitled *Show Rule*, to the rule that generated the issue.

.Expanded issue

== Technologies report

Access this report from the report landing page by clicking the *Technologies* link.

This report provides an aggregate listing of the technologies used, grouped by function, for the analyzed applications. It shows how the technologies are distributed, and is typically reviewed after analyzing a large number of applications to group the applications and identify patterns. It also shows the size, number of libraries, and story point totals of each application.

Clicking any of the headers, such as *Markup*, sorts the results in descending order. Selecting the same header again will resort the results in ascending order. The currently selected header is identified in bold, next to a directional arrow, indicating the direction of the sort.
