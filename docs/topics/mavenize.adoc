= Mavenizing your application

{ProductShortName} provides the ability to generate an Apache Maven project structure based on the application provided. This will create a directory structure with the necessary Maven Project Object Model (POM) files that specify the appropriate dependencies.

Note that this feature is not intended to create a final solution for your project. It is meant to give you a starting point and identify the necessary dependencies and APIs for your application. Your project may require further customization.

== Generating the Maven project structure

You can generate a Maven project structure for the provided application by passing in the `--mavenize` flag when executing {ProductShortName}.

The following example runs {ProductShortName} using the link:https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear[jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear] test application:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ <{ProductShortName}_HOME>/bin/{mta-cli} --input /path/to/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear --output /path/to/output --target eap:6 --packages com.acme org.apache --mavenize
----

This generates the Maven project structure in the `/path/to/output/mavenized` directory.

NOTE: You can only use the `--mavenize` option when providing a compiled application for the `--input` argument. This feature is not available when running {ProductShortName} against source code.

You can also use the `--mavenizeGroupId` option to specify the `<groupId>` to be used for the POM files. If unspecified, {ProductShortName} will attempt to identify an appropriate `<groupId>` for the application, or will default to `com.mycompany.mavenized`.

== Reviewing the Maven project structure

The `/path/to/output/mavenized/<APPLICATION_NAME>/` directory contains the following items:

* A root `POM` file. This is the `pom.xml` file at the top-level directory.
* A BOM file. This is the `POM` file in the directory ending with `-bom`.
* One or more application `POM` files. Each module has its `POM` file in a directory named after the archive.

The example `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear` application is an EAR archive that contains a WAR and several JARs. There is a separate directory created for each of these artifacts. Below is the Maven project structure created for this application.

[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]

/path/to/output/mavenized/jee-example-app/
    jee-example-app-bom/pom.xml
    jee-example-app-ear/pom.xml
    jee-example-services2-jar/pom.xml
    jee-example-services-jar/pom.xml
    jee-example-web-war/pom.xml
    pom.xml
----

Review each of the generated files and customize as appropriate for your project. To learn more about Maven POM files, see the link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html[Introduction to the POM] section of the Apache Maven documentation.

=== Root POM file

The root POM file for the `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear` application can be found at `/path/to/output/mavenized/jee-example-app/pom.xml`. This file identifies the directories for all of the project modules.

The following modules are listed in the root POM for the example `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear` application.

// TODO: These modules were manually reversed so that the order was more appropriate. The order may be fixed in a future Windup JIRA.
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<modules>
  <module>jee-example-app-bom</module>
  <module>jee-example-services2-jar</module>
  <module>jee-example-services-jar</module>
  <module>jee-example-web-war</module>
  <module>jee-example-app-ear</module>
</modules>
----

NOTE: Be sure to reorder the list of modules if necessary so that they are listed in an appropriate build order for your project.

The root POM is also configured to use the link:https://maven.repository.redhat.com/[Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Maven repository] to download project dependencies.


[id="bom-file_{context}"]
[discrete]
=== BOM file

The Bill of Materials (BOM) file is generated in the directory ending in `-bom`. For the example `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear` application, the BOM file can be found at `/path/to/output/mavenized/jee-example-app/jee-example-app-bom/pom.xml`. The purpose of this BOM is to have the versions of third-party dependencies used by the project defined in one place. For more information on using a BOM, see the link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html[Introduction to the dependency mechanism] section of the Apache Maven documentation.

The following dependencies are listed in the BOM for the example `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear` application

=== Application POM files

Each application module that can be mavenized has a separate directory containing its POM file. The directory name contains the name of the archive and ends in a `-jar`, `-war`, or `-ear` suffix, depending on the archive type.

Each application POM file lists that module's dependencies, including:

* Third-party libraries
* Java EE APIs
* Application submodules

For example, the POM file for the `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear` EAR, `/path/to/output/mavenized/jee-example-app/jee-example-app-ear/pom.xml`, lists the following dependencies.

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
