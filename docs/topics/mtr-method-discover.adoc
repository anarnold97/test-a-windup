The _Discover_ phase is when you gather all stakeholders and decision-makers together to understand the current state and business drivers, and to determine the migration or modernization needs.

In this phase, you can do the following:

* Explore technologies and discuss potential approaches.
* Identify the existing pain points, concerns, requirements, and some potential challenges.
* Define the high-level business priorities, and scope the assessment.
* Determine in what ways you want to modernize your application development and delivery to allow you to innovate more rapidly.

Typically, this can be covered in a day in a workshop with Red Hat experts.
