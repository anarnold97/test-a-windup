= Reviewing existing {ProductShortName} XML rules

{ProductShortName} XML-based rules are located on GitHub at the following location: link:https://github.com/windup/windup-rulesets/tree/master/rules/rules-reviewed[https://github.com/windup/windup-rulesets/tree/master/rules/rules-reviewed].

You can fork and clone the {ProductShortName} XML rules on your local machine.

Rules are grouped by target platform and function. When you create a new rule, it is helpful to find a rule that is similar to the one you need and use it as a starting template.

New rules are continually added, so it is a good idea to check back frequently to review the updates.
