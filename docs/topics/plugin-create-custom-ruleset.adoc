= Creating a custom ruleset

You can create a new custom ruleset in the {PluginName} to use during analysis of your projects.

.Procedure

. From the {ProductShortName} perspective, open the *Rulesets* tab.
. Click the create ruleset icon (image:repository-new.gif[Create ruleset icon]).
. Select the project and directory to save the new ruleset in.
. Enter the file name for the ruleset file.
+
NOTE: The XML rule file must use the `.windup.xml` or `.mta.xml` extension in order to be recognized as an {ProductShortName} rule.
. Enter a ruleset ID, for example, `my-ruleset-id`.
. Optionally, check the *Generate quickstart template* checkbox to add basic rule templates to the ruleset file.
. Select *Finish*.
. The new ruleset file opens in an editor and you can add and edit rules in the file. You can also select the *Source* tab to edit the XML source for the ruleset file.

This new ruleset can now be selected in run configurations when analyzing projects.
