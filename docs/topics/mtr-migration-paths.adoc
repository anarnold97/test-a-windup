= Supported migration paths

The {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) supports migrations from third-party enterprise application servers, such as Oracle WebLogic Server, to JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) and upgrades to the latest release of JBoss EAP.

You can run an {ProductShortName} analysis to assess your applications' suitability for migration to multiple target platforms.
