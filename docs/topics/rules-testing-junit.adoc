= Testing the rules by using JUnit

Once a test rule has been created, it can be analyzed as part of a JUnit test to confirm that the rule meets all criteria for execution. The `WindupRulesMultipleTests` class in the {ProductShortName} rules repository is designed to test multiple rules simultaneously, and provides feedback on any missing requirements.

.Prerequisites

* Fork and clone the {ProductShortName} XML rules. The location of this repository will be referred to as <RULESETS_REPO>.
* Create a test XML rule.

.Creating the JUnit test configuration

The following instructions detail creating a JUnit test using Eclipse. When using a different IDE, it is recommended to consult your IDE's documentation for instructions on creating a JUnit test.

. Import the {ProductShortName} rulesets repository into your IDE.
. Copy the custom rules, along with the corresponding tests and data, into `</path/to/RULESETS_REPO>/rules-reviewed/<RULE_NAME>/`. This should create the following directory structure.

.Directory structure
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
├── *rules-reviewed/*  _(Root directory of the rules found within the project)_
│   ├── *<RULE_NAME>/*  _(Directory to contain the newly developed rule and tests)_
│   │   ├── *<RULE_NAME>.windup.xml*  _(Custom rule)_
│   │   ├── *tests/*  _(Directory that contains any test rules and data)_
│   │   │   ├── *<RULE_NAME>.windup.test.xml* _(Test rule)_
│   │   │   └── *data/*  _(Optional directory to contain test rule data)_
----

. Select *Run* from the top menu bar.
. Select *Run Configurations...* from the drop down that appears.
. Right-click *JUnit* from the options on the left side and select *New*.
. Enter the following:
+
** *Name*: A name for your JUnit test, such as `WindupRulesMultipleTests`.
** *Project*: Ensure this is set to `windup-rulesets`.
** *Test class*: Set this to `org.jboss.windup.rules.tests.WindupRulesMultipleTests`.

. Select the *Arguments* tab, and add the `-DrunTestsMatching=<RULE_NAME>` VM argument. For instance, if your rule name was `community-rules`, then you would add `-DrunTestsMatching=community-rules` as seen in the following image.

. Click *Run* in the bottom right corner to begin the test.
+
When the execution completes, the results are available for analysis. If all tests passed, then the test rule is correctly formatted. If all tests did not pass, it is recommended to address each of the issues raised in the test failures.
