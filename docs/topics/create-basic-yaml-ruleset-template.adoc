= Creating a basic YAML ruleset template

If you want to group multiple similar rules, you can create a ruleset for them by placing their files in a directory and creating a `ruleset.yaml` file at the directory's root. When you pass this directory as input to the {ProductShortName} {CLIName} using the `--rules` option, {ProductShortName} treats all the files in the directory as belonging to the ruleset defined in the `ruleset.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Create a template for `ruleset.yaml` files if you want to pass the entire directory using the `--rules` option:
+
[source,terminal]
----
name: <RULESET_NAME> <1>
description: <RULESET_DESCRIPTION>
labels: <2>
  - key=val
----
<1> The name must be unique within the provided rulesets.
+
<2> Ruleset labels are inherited by all rules that belong to the ruleset.
