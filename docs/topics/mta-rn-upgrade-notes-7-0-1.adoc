.Upgrade from {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 to {ProductShortName} 7.0.1

.Pathfinder assessment migration fails on upgrade from {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 to {ProductShortName} 7.0.0

In previous version of {ProductShortName} 7.0.0, when {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 is installed, and you attempt to switch the channel to `stable-7.0`, the operator upgrade succeeds, but a task in the operator pod fails. This failure resulted in existing pathfinder assessments not being migrated to {ProductShortName} 7.0.0. As this bug has been resolved in {ProductShortName} 7.0.1, it is suggested to upgrade directly from {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 to {ProductShortName} 7.0.1. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2139[MTA-2139]

.Hub database volume size

In version 7.0.1 of {ProductShortName}, the default size of the hub database volume has been increased to 10GiB.

If your storage class does not support volume expansion, then an upgrade from 6.2.1 to 7.0.1 will result in a failure due to the operator trying to change the volume size from 5GiB to 10GiB.

To avoid this issue, you can directly set the volume size by setting:

[source,yaml]
----
...
hub_database_volume_size: 5Gi
...
----

By doing this, you will avoid the operator trying to resize the volume.

If this value was set when the previous version was deployed, there is no need to take any action, as it will work as expected.


.Existing data

When upgrading to {ProductShortName} 7.0.0, all existing data will be retained, except for individual analysis reports for applications.

As both the analysis and reporting engines have been replaced with this version, you will be required to conduct a re-run of the analysis in order to obtain data on issues and dependencies.
