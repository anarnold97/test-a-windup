= Importing a custom ruleset

You can import an existing custom ruleset into the {PluginName} to use during analysis of your projects.

. From the {ProductShortName} perspective, open the *Rulesets* tab.
. Click the import ruleset icon (image:import-repository.png[Import ruleset icon]).
. Browse to and select the XML rule file to import.
+
NOTE: The XML rule file must use the `.windup.xml` or `.mta.xml` extension in order to be recognized as an {ProductShortName} rule.
. The custom ruleset is now shown under the *Custom* item in the *Rulesets* tab.

This custom ruleset can now be selected in run configurations when analyzing projects.

See the link:{ProductDocRulesGuideURL}[_{RulesDevBookName}_] to learn more about creating custom XML rules.
