{ProductFullName} version 7.0.0 has the following issues.

.Pathfinder assessment migration fails on upgrade from {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 to {ProductShortName} 7.0.0

If {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 is installed, when attempting to switch the channel to `stable-7.0`, the operator upgrade succeeds, but a task in the operator pod fails. This failure results in existing pathfinder assessments not being migrated to {ProductShortName} 7.0.0. This bug will be resolved in {ProductShortName} 7.0.1. No assessment data will be lost, it is will simply not be visible in the UI until the release of {ProductShortName} 7.0.1. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2139[MTA-2139]

.Delayed permission update and user deactivation in `RBAC`

When deleting, deactivating or degrading the role of a user, such as changing the user from `Admin` to `Migrator`, the change can take several minutes to take effect. This delay in changing the user status can pose an operational or security risk. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1809[MTA-1809]

.Re-enabling Keycloak breaks {ProductShortName}

Keycloak is enabled by default. If you disable and then re-enable Keycloak, you cannot perform any actions in the {ProductShortName} web console after logging in again.

This error is caused as the `credential-mta-rhsso` secret is updated when `auth/Keycloak` is disabled and re-enabled.

The suggested workaround is to restore the old password in the `credential-mta-rhsso` secret, after re-enabling `auth`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1152[MTA-1152]


.org.apache.derby.derby dependency not analyzed

The `org.apache.derby.derby` dependency is not analyzed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1817[MTA-1817]

.Redundant warning on reassessment of applications with inherited assessments

The system repeatedly shows a warning message about overriding an inherited assessment when reassessing an application.

This warning, appropriate for the first assessment, incorrectly reappears on subsequent reassessments, suggesting that the application is still inheriting its assessment, even after it has been overridden. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1825[MTA-1825]
