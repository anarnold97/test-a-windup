.Cannot create a Jira instance behind a proxy

Red Hat Jira instance (issues.stage.redhat.com) is accessible only through a proxy, but general proxy settings do not work with this configuration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-849[MTA-849]

.Rows in `Dependencies` show placeholder instead of actual value

.Source analysis shows different issues for `tackle-testapp`

Running a source analysis using `tackle-testapp` with target as `containerization` or `cloud-readiness` shows missing categories. `Issues` has only `Mandatory` category with two issues, and no `Information` category. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1271[MTA-1271]

.Delayed permission update and user deactivation in `RBACK`
