= Running {ProductShortName}

Once a run configuration has been created, you can run {ProductShortName} using that configuration in one of the following ways:

* Select the run configuration from the *Run Configurations* dialog and click *Run*.
* Select a recent run configuration from the drop down next to the *Run* button (image:run_exc.png[Run button]).

If the {ProductShortName} server is not currently running, it will start once a run configuration is executed.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not plan to run {ProductShortName} in the near future, stop the {ProductShortName} server to conserve memory on your machine.
====

Once execution is complete, the Issue Explorer will be populated with {ProductShortName} issues.
