* Directory specified by the `--userRulesDirectory` argument on the {ProductShortName} command line.
* `<MTA_HOME>/rules/` directory. `<MTA_HOME>` is the directory where you install and run the {ProductName} executable.
* `${user.home}/.mta/rules/` directory. This directory is created by {ProductShortName} the first time it is run. it contains rules, add-ons, and the {ProductShortName} log.
