[id="mta-custom-questionnaire_{context}"]
= Custom questionnaire

{ProductFullName} allows you to import custom questionnaires using a custom YAML syntax for questionnaire definition.

The syntax supports:

* Conditional questions
* Automated answers based on tags present on the assessed application or archetype
* Autotagging of applications based on answers

[id="mta-assessment-questionnaire-fields_{context}"]
== Questionnaire fields


* `name`: Name of the questionnaire. `name` is required and must be unique for the entire {ProductShortName} instance.
* `description`: An optional short description of the questionnaire.
* `thresholds`: Required the threshold definition for each risk category for the application or the archetype to be considered affected by that risk level. The higher risk level always takes precedence. For example, if yellow threshold is established in 30% and red in 5%, and the answers for an application or archetype to have 35% yellow and 6% red, the risk level for the application or archetype will be red.
** `red`: Required numeric percentage (example: `30` for `30%`) of red answers the questionnaire can have until the risk level is considered red.
** `yellow`: Required numeric percentage (example: `30` for `30%`) of yellow answers the questionnaire can have until the risk level is considered
yellow.
** `unknown`: Required numeric percentage (example: `30` for `30%`) of unknown answers the questionnaire can have until the risk level is considered
unknown.
* `riskMessages`: Required messages to be displayed in reports for each risk category. The _risk_messages_ map is defined by the following fields:
** `red`: Required string message to display in reports for the red risk level.
** `yellow`: Required string message to display in reports for the yellow risk level.
** `green`: Required string message to display in reports for the green risk level.
** `unknown`: Required string message to display in reports for the unknown risk level.
* `sections`: Required list of sections that the questionnaire will include.
** `name`: Name is the required string to be displayed for the section.
** `order`: Required int order in which the question should appear in the section.
** `comment`: Optional string to describe the section.

*** `explanation`: Optional string of additional explanations for the question.
*** `includeFor`: Optional list that defines a question should be displayed if any of the tags included in the list is present in the target application or archetype.
**** `category`: Required string category of the target tag.
**** `tag`: Required string for the target tag.
*** `excludeFor`: Optional list defines that a question should be skipped if any of the tags included in the list is present in the target application or archetype.
**** `category`: Required string category of the target tag.
**** `tag`: Required string for the target tag.
*** `answers`: Required list of answers for the given question.
**** `order`: Required int order in which the question should appear in the section.
**** `text`: Required string the actual answer for the question.
**** `risk`: Required to be one of red, yellow, green, or unknown. The risk level of the current answer implied.
**** `rationale`: Optional string explaining the justification for the answer being considered a risk.
**** `mitigation`: Optional string for an explanation of the potential mitigation strategy for the risk implied by this answer.
**** `applyTags`: Optional list that defines a list of tags to be automatically applied to the assessed application or archetype if this answer is selected.
***** `category`: Required string category of the target tag.
***** `tag`: Required string for the target tag.
**** `autoAnswerFor`: Optional list defines a list of tags that will lead to this answer being automatically selected when the application or archetype is assessed.

***** `category`: Required string category of the target tag.
***** `tag`: Required string for the target tag.

[id="mta-conditional-questionnaire_{context}"]
== Conditional questions

The syntax supports excluding or including questions based on tags existing on the application or archetype. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
...
  questions:
    - order: 1
      text: What is the main JAVA framework used in your application?
      explanation: Identify the primary JAVA framework used in your application.

        - category: Language
          tag: Java
...

[id="mta-automated-answers_{context}"]
== Automated answers

Automated answers mean that answers are automatically selected when the application or archetype is assessed.

In the following example, if an application or archetype is tagged `Runtime/Quarkus`, then the `Quarkus` answer is automatically selected. While if an application or archetype is tagged `Runtime/Spring Boot`, then the 'Spring Boot' answer choice is automatically selected.

          risk: green

[id="mta-autotagging-answers_{context}"]
== Autotagging of applications based on answers

Autotagging of applications based on answers means that tags are automatically applied to the assessed application or archetype, if this answer is selected.

The tags are transitive.

Each tag is defined by the following two required elements:

* *category*: Category of the target tag (`String`).
* *tag*: Definition for the target tag as (`String`).

In the following example, if the answer selected is `Quarkus`, then the `Runtime/Quarkus` tag is applied to the assessed application or archetype. While if the answer selected is `Spring Boot`, then the `Runtime/Spring Boot` tag is applied to the assessed application or archetype.
