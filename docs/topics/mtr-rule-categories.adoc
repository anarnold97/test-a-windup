[id="rule-categories_{context}"]
= Using custom rule categories

You can create custom rule categories and assign {ProductShortName} rules to them.

[NOTE]
====
Although {ProductShortName} processes rules with the legacy `severity` field, you must update your custom rules to use the new `category-id` field.
====

[id="add_custom_category_{context}"]
== Adding a custom category

You can add a custom category to the rule category file.

        ...
    </when>
    <perform>
