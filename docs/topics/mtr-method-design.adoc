The _Design_ phase is when you identify all risks, define a strategy and target architecture, prove the technology, and build the business case. This phase consists of the following steps:

Assess::
+
Examine the existing infrastructure, architecture, technologies, and applications. Identify dependencies, knowledge, processes, and lifecycles. Define the desired infrastructure, architecture, technologies, and applications. Determine the feasibility and potential risks. Draft a plan and provide rough estimates.
+
Analyzing applications using the {ProductName} {WebName} or {CLIName} helps to determine dependencies, potential risks, and relative effort. See the link:{ProductDocWebConsoleGuideURL}[_{WebConsoleBookName}_] or link:{ProductDocUserGuideURL}[_{UserCLIBookName}_] for information on how to use these tools.

Prove::
+
Solve and document the identified technical risks, for example, high risk items and issues with unknown effort. Build and shape the new platform infrastructure. Refine the estimates based on the outcomes.

Pilot::
+
Choose a small set of representative applications to transform. Finalize the target platform infrastructure as necessary. Update the documentation as the process is fine-tuned. This pilot consists of one or several iterations of the migration execution, which is scaled during the Deploy phase.
+
Use the {ProductName} {PluginName} to accelerate the code migration. See the link:{EclipseCrsGuideURL}[_{EclipseCrsGuideTitle}_] for information on how to use the {PluginName}.

Plan::
+
Based on the outcomes of the previous steps, sharpen the estimates and refine the project plan. Define the rollout strategy to be used in the Deploy phase to complete the migration. Prepare and schedule the relevant link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training[technical enablement courses].
