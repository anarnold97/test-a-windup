.CVE-2023-26159: `follow-redirects` package before 1.15.4 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation

Versions of the `follow-redirects`Â package before 1.15.4 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation. This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of URLs by the `url.parse()` function. When a new URL returns an error, it can be manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.
