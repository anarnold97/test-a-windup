[id='plugin-use-custom-rules_{context}']
= Adding custom rules

By default, the {PluginName} comes with a core set of system rules for identifying migration and modernization issues. You can browse the existing rules from the {PluginName}.

You can create your own rules for identifying issues specific to your applications. You can either import an existing custom ruleset or create a custom ruleset directly in the {PluginName}.
