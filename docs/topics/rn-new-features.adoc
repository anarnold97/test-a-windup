.Rules for migrating to the latest version of Quarkus

The current release contains rules for migrating to the latest version of Quarkus. The target of these rules is `quarkus<version>`, for example, `quarkus1:11` for Quarkus 1.11.x.

These rules ensure that the applications are migrated to a target that has the latest features, resolved issues, and patches.

These rules will be updated for future Quarkus releases.
