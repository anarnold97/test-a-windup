[id="xml-rule-when-syntax_{context}"]
= `<when>` syntax

Conditions allowed in the `when` portion of a rule must extend http://windup.github.io/windup/docs/latest/javadoc/org/jboss/windup/config/operation/GraphOperation.html[GraphOperation] and currently include evaluation of Java classes, XML files, projects, and file content. Because XML rules are modeled after the Java-based rule add-ons, links to JavaDocs for the related Java classes are provided for a better understanding of how they behave.

The complete XML rule schema is located here: http://windup.jboss.org/schema/windup-jboss-ruleset.xsd.

The following sections describe the more common XML `when` rule conditions.

* <javaclass> condition syntax
* <xmlfile> condition syntax
* <project> condition syntax
* <filecontent> condition syntax
* <file> condition syntax
* <has-hint> condition syntax
* <has-classification> condition syntax
* <graph-query> condition syntax
* <dependency> condition syntax

By default, if more than one `when` rule condition is provided, then all conditions must be met for the rule to match.

=== Summary

Use the `<javaclass>` element to find imports, methods, variable declarations, annotations, class implementations, and other items related to Java classes. For a better understanding of the `<javaclass>` condition, see the JavaDoc for the http://windup.github.io/windup/docs/latest/javadoc/org/jboss/windup/rules/apps/java/condition/JavaClass.html[JavaClass] class.

The following is an example of a rule that tests for WebLogic-specific Apache XML packages:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<rule id="weblogic-03000">
    <when>
        <javaclass references="weblogic.apache.xml.{*}" />

=== Construct a <javaclass> element

==== <javaclass> element attributes

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|====
|Attribute name
|Type
|Description

|references
|CLASS_NAME
a|The package or class name to match on. Wildcard characters can be used. This attribute is required.

NOTE: For performance reasons, you should not start the reference with wildcard characters. For example, use [x-]`weblogic.apache.xml.{*}` instead of [x-]`{web}.apache.xml.{*}`.

[options="nowrap"]
----
references="weblogic.apache.xml.{*}"
----
|matchesSource
|STRING
a|An exact regex to match. This is useful to distinguish hard-coded strings. This attribute is required.

[options="nowrap"]
----
matchesSource="log4j.logger"
----

|as
|VARIABLE_NAME
a|A variable name assigned to the rule so that it can be used as a reference in later processing. See the `from` attribute below.

[options="nowrap"]
----
as="MyEjbRule"
----

|from
|VARIABLE_NAME
a|Begin the search query with the filtered result from a previous search identified by its `as` VARIABLE_NAME.

[options="nowrap"]
----
from="MyEjbRule"
----

|in
|PATH_FILTER
a|Filter input files matching this regex (regular expression) naming pattern. Wildcard characters can be used.

==== <javaclass> child elements

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|====
|Child Element
|Description

|<location>
a|The location where the reference was found in a Java class. Location can refer to annotations, field and variable declarations, imports, and methods. For the complete list of valid values, see the JavaDoc for http://windup.github.io/windup/docs/latest/javadoc/org/jboss/windup/ast/java/data/TypeReferenceLocation.html[TypeReferenceLocation].

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<location>IMPORT</location>
----

|<annotation-literal>
a|Match on literal values inside of annotations.

The following example matches on `@MyAnnotation(myvalue="test")`.

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<javaclass references="org.package.MyAnnotation">
    <location>ANNOTATION</location>
    <annotation-literal name="myvalue" pattern="test"/>
</javaclass>
----

Note that in this case, the `<javaclass>` refers to an annotation (`@MyAnnotation`), so the top-level annotation filter, `<annotation-literal>` must specify the `name` attribute. If the `<javaclass>` referred to a class that is annotated, then the top-level annotation filter used would be `<annotation-type>`.

|<annotation-type>
a|Match on a particular annotation type. You can supply subconditions to be matched against the annotation elements.

The below example would match on a `Calendar` field declaration annotated with `@MyAnnotation(myvalue="test")`.

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<javaclass references="java.util.Calendar">
    <location>FIELD_DECLARATION</location>
    <annotation-type pattern="org.package.MyAnnotation">
        <annotation-literal name="myvalue" pattern="test"/>
    </annotation-type>
</javaclass>
----

|<annotation-list>
a|Match on an item in an array within an annotation. If an array index is not specified, the condition will be matched if it applies to any item in the array. You can supply subconditions to be matched against this element.

The below example would match on `@MyAnnotation(mylist={"one","two"})`.

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<javaclass references="org.package.MyAnnotation" >
    <location>ANNOTATION</location>
    <annotation-list name="mylist">
        <annotation-literal pattern="two"/>
    </annotation-list>
</javaclass>
----

Note that in this case, the `<javaclass>` refers to an annotation (`@MyAnnotation`), so the top-level annotation filter, `<annotation-list>` must specify the `name` attribute. If the `<javaclass>` referred to a class that is annotated, then the top-level annotation filter used would be `<annotation-type>`.

[id="has-hint-syntax_{context}"]
== <has-hint> syntax

=== Summary

Use the `<has-hint>` element to test whether a file or line has a hint already associated with it. It is primarily used to prevent firing if a hint already exists, or to implement rules for default execution when no other conditions apply. For a better understanding of the `<has-hint>` condition, see the JavaDoc for the http://windup.github.io/windup/docs/latest/javadoc/org/jboss/windup/reporting/config/HasHint.html[HasHint] class.
