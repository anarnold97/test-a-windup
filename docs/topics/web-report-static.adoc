= Static reports

The original static HTML reports that can be generated when using the {ProductShortName} {CLIName} are also available from the {WebName}. Clicking on the *Static Reports* link from the Execution details page opens a new window with these reports.

NOTE: Your execution configuration must have selected the *Create static HTML reports* for these reports to be generated.

These static reports are useful because there are several reports that are not yet integrated with the {WebName}, for example, hard-coded IP addresses, server resources, and dependencies.
