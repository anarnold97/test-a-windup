= Running the {MavenNameTitle}

The {MavenName} is executed by including a reference to the plugin inside your application's `pom.xml` file. When the application is built, the {MavenName} is executed and generates the reports for analysis.

.Prerequisites

* OpenJDK 1.8, OpenJDK 11, Oracle JDK 1.8, _or_ Oracle JDK 11
* 8 GB RAM
* Maven 3.2.5 or later
* If you are installing on macOS, the value of `maxproc` must be `2048` or greater.

.Procedure

. Add the following `<plugin>` to your application's `pom.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
[...]
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jboss.windup.plugin</groupId>
    <artifactId>windup-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{MavenProductVersion}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>run-windup</id>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>windup</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <offlineMode>true</offlineMode> <1>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
[...]
----
<1> `offlineMode` runs the {MavenName} in offline mode, disabling network features to improve performance.

. If using Java 11, then `--add-modules=java.se` must be added to the `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable. When using older versions of Java this is not necessary, and you can proceed to the next step.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
export MAVEN_OPTS=--add-modules=java.se
