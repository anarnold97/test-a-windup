The following highlighted issues have been resolved in {ProductFullName} version 7.0.1.

.Pathfinder assessment migration fails on upgrade from {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 to {ProductShortName} 7.0.0

In previous version of {ProductShortName} 7.0.0, when {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 is installed, and you attempt to switch the channel to `stable-7.0`, the operator upgrade succeeds, but a task in the operator pod fails. This failure resulted in existing pathfinder assessments not being migrated to {ProductShortName} 7.0.0. This bug is resolved in {ProductShortName} 7.0.1. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2139[MTA-2139]
