=== Issues report

Access this report from the dashboard by clicking the *Issues* link.

This report includes details about every issue that was raised by the selected migration paths. The following information is provided for each issue encountered:

* A title to summarize the issue.
* The total number of incidents, or times the issue was encountered.
* The rule story points to resolve a single instance of the issue.
* The estimated level of effort to resolve the issue.
* The total story points to resolve every instance encountered. This is calculated by multiplying the number of incidents found by the story points per incident.

.Issues report
image::report-jee-example-application-issues.png[Issues report]

Each reported issue may be expanded, by clicking on the title, to obtain additional details. The following information is provided.

* A list of files where the incidents occurred, along with the number of incidents within each file. If the file is a Java source file, then clicking the filename will direct you to the corresponding Source Report.
* A detailed description of the issue. This description outlines the problem, provides any known solutions, and references supporting documentation regarding either the issue or resolution.
* A direct link, entitled *Show Rule*, to the rule that generated the issue.

.Expanded Issue
image::report-jee-example-application-issues-2.png[Expanded rule in the issues report]

Issues are sorted into four categories by default. Information on these categories is available at ask Category.

=== Application Details report

Access this report from the dashboard by clicking the *Application Details* link.

The report lists the story points, the Java incidents by package, and a count of the occurrences of the technologies found in the application. Next is a display of application messages generated during the migration process. Finally, there is a breakdown of this information for each archive analyzed during the process.

.Application Details report
image::report-jee-example-application-details.png[Application Details report]

Expand the `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear/jee-example-services.jar` to review the story points, Java incidents by package, and a count of the occurrences of the technologies found in this archive. This summary begins with a total of the story points assigned to its migration, followed by a table detailing the changes required for each file in the archive. The report contains the following columns.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|====
| Column Name
| Description

| Name
| The name of the file being analyzed.

| Technology
| The type of file being analyzed, for example, *Decompiled Java File* or *Properties*.

| Issues
| Warnings about areas of code that need review or changes.

| Story Points
a| Level of effort required to migrate the file.

Note that if an archive is duplicated several times in an application, it will be listed just once in the report and will be tagged with `[Included multiple times]`.

.Duplicate archive in an application

=== Technologies report

Access this report from the dashboard by clicking the *Technologies* link.

The report lists the occurrences of technologies, grouped by function, in the analyzed application. It is an overview of the technologies found in the application, and is designed to assist users in quickly understanding each application's purpose.

The below image shows the technologies used in the `jee-example-app`.

=== Application Dependencies Graph report

The analyzed applications' dependencies are shown in this report, accessible from the *Dependencies Graph* link from the dashboard.

It includes a list of all WARs and JARs, including third-party JARs, and graphs the relations between each of the included files. Each circle in the graph represents a unique dependency defined in the application.

The below image shows the dependencies used in the `jee-example-app`, with the selected application in the center of the graph.

.Graph of dependencies in an application
image::report-jee-example-application-dependencies.png[Dependencies Graph application view]

.Interacting with the Dependencies Graph

The dependencies graph may be adjusted by using any of the following.

* Clicking a dependency will display the name of the application in the upper-left corner. While selected the dependency will have a shaded circle identifying it, as seen on the center in the above image.
* Clicking and dragging a circle will reposition it. Releasing the mouse will fix the dependency to the cursor's location.
* Clicking on a fixed dependency will release it, returning the dependency to its default distance from the application.
* Double clicking anywhere will return the entire graph to the default state.
* Clicking on any item in the legend will enable or disable all items of the selected type. For instance, selecting the embedded WARs icon will disable all embedded WARs if these are enabled, and will enable these dependencies if they are disabled.

=== Source Report

The analysis of the `jee-example-services.jar` lists the files in the JAR and the warnings and story points assigned to each one. Notice the `com.acme.anvil.listener.AnvilWebLifecycleListener` file, at the time of this test, has 22 warnings and is assigned 16 story points. Click the file link to see the detail.

* The *Information* section provides a summary of the story points.
* This is followed by the file source code. Warnings appear in the file at the point where  migration is required.

In this example, warnings appear at various import statements, declarations, and method calls. Each warning describes the issue and the action that should be taken.

== Technologies report

Access this report from the report landing page by clicking the *Technologies* link.

This report provides an aggregate listing of the technologies used, grouped by function, for the analyzed applications. It shows how the technologies are distributed, and is typically reviewed after analyzing a large number of applications to group the applications and identify patterns. It also shows the size, number of libraries, and story point totals of each application.

Clicking any of the headers, such as *Markup*, sorts the results in descending order. Selecting the same header again will resort the results in ascending order. The currently selected header is identified in bold, next to a directional arrow, indicating the direction of the sort.

== Dependencies Graph report

Access this report from the report landing page by clicking the *Dependencies Graph* link.

It includes a list of all WARs and JARs, and graphs the relations between each of the included files. Each circle in the graph represents a unique dependency defined in the application. If a file is included as a dependency in multiple applications, these are linked in the graph.

In the below image we can see two distinct groups. On the left half we see a single WAR that defines several JARs as dependencies. On the right half we see the same dependencies used by multiple WARs, one of which is the seelcted `overlord-commons-auth-2.0.11.Final.jar`.

.Dependencies graph across multiple applications
