= Use of `<MTA_HOME>` in this guide

This guide uses the `<MTA_HOME>` replaceable variable to denote the path to your {ProductShortName} installation. The installation directory is the `{ProductDistribution}` directory where you extracted the {ProductShortName} `.zip` file.

[NOTE]
====
For Windows operating systems, you must extract the {ProductShortName} `.zip` file to a folder named `mta` to avoid a `Path too long` error.
====

When you encounter `<MTA_HOME>` in this guide, replace it with the actual path to your {ProductShortName} installation.
