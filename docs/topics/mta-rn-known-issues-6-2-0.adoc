MTA version 6.2.0 has the following issues.

.Re-enabling Keycloak breaks MTA

Keycloak is enabled by default. If you disable and then re-enable Keycloak, you cannot perform any actions in the MTA web console after logging in again.

This error is caused as the `credential-mta-rhsso` secret is updated when `auth/Keycloak` is disabled and re-enabled.

The suggested workaround is to restore the old password in the `credential-mta-rhsso` secret, after re-enabling `auth`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1152[MTA-1152]

.Analysis fails when fetching rules from a repository with a folder that contains spaces in its name

When fetching custom rules from a repository during an analysis, if the `Root path` field contains spaces, the `mta-cli` command is not properly composed and the analysis fails. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-458[MTA-458]

.Update notifications are disabled for Application, Job functions, and Business services

Update notifications are disabled for **Application**, **Job function** and **Business services**, as a result, no notifications are displayed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1024[MTA-1024]

.Repository type field is not required

The **Repository type** field is not required when saving the configuring rule files from a repository in analysis. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1047[MTA-1047]

.False 'not connected' status for new Jira instance

When creating a new Jira instance, the connection status is initially shown as **Not connected** before it moves to **Connected**, and this delay could cause the user to think that the provided credentials are incorrect. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1019[MTA-1019]
