MTA version 6.2.0 has the following issues.

.CVE-2023-44487: Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)

A flaw has been found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol. The HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can be reset multiple streams quickly. The server has to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection, which resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption.

The following issues have been listed under this issue:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1428[(MTA-1428)]
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1430[(MTA-1430)]
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1448[(MTA-1448)]

To resolve this issue, upgrade to {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 or later.

.CVE-2023-39325: Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack in the Go language packages)

The HTTP/2 protocol is susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation can reset multiple streams quickly. The server has to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This results in a denial of service due to server resource consumption.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1447[MTA-1447]

To resolve this issue, upgrade to {ProductShortName} 6.2.1 or later.

.Re-enabling Keycloak breaks MTA

Keycloak is enabled by default. If you disable and then re-enable Keycloak, you cannot perform any actions in the MTA web console after logging in again.

This error is caused as the `credential-mta-rhsso` secret is updated when `auth/Keycloak` is disabled and re-enabled.

The suggested workaround is to restore the old password in the `credential-mta-rhsso` secret, after re-enabling `auth`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1152[MTA-1152]

.Analysis fails when fetching rules from a repository with a folder that contains spaces in its name

When fetching custom rules from a repository during an analysis, if the `Root path` field contains spaces, the `mta-cli` command is not properly composed and the analysis fails. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-458[MTA-458]

.Update notifications are disabled for Application, Job functions, and Business services

Update notifications are disabled for **Application**, **Job function** and **Business services**, as a result, no notifications are displayed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1024[MTA-1024]

.Repository type field is not required

The **Repository type** field is not required when saving the configuring rules files from a repository in analysis. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1047[MTA-1047]

.False 'not connected' status for new Jira instance

When creating a new Jira instance, the connection status is initially shown as **Not connected** before it moves to **Connected**, and this delay could cause the user to think that the provided credentials are incorrect. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1019[MTA-1019]
