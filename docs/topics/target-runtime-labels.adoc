= Target Runtime Labels (including custom Target Runtime Labels)

The Target Runtime feature assesses all of the Technology Tags identified for each application for compatibility with specific runtimes.
JBoss EAP and JWS are the two Target Runtime definitions that are included in the {ProductShortName} distribution.
Target Runtime definitions are extensible enabling you to use custom Target Runtimes in analysis executions.
