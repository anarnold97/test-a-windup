The approach consists of the following phases:

Discover:: Explore the technologies and identify concerns, organization requirements and challenges. Discuss options and potential approaches.

Design:: Identify and mitigate the biggest risks from an application, infrastructure, process, and knowledge perspective. Establish a strategy for the solution. Prove the technology and build the business case.

Deploy:: Scale the modernization or migration iteratively by executing the previously defined strategy according to a well-defined delivery model.
